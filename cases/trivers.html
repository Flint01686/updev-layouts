            <h3 class="left">What was at the Start?</h3>
            <p>Maxim and Alexander came to us on a recommendation after an unsuccessful experience working with another
              IT company that developed MVP for them.
            </p>
            <p>They turned to us with the following problem: the developed applications turned out to be incomplete,
              with a large number of bugs, complex, and not demonstrative for end users. In addition, the company has
              delayed the deadlines for the delivery of software twice.</p>
            <p>At that time, they already had two mobile applications that allow digitizing the application management
              process on the part of the customer and on the part of the contractor, and the contractor's web
              application for managing applications was also already developed.</p>

            <h3 class="center">Cooperation</h3>
            <p><span class="title-small">Duration: 6 months by T&M</span></p>
            <p>From the beginning, we have built a loyal relationship with each other. We demonstrated the entire
              "internal kitchen", provided detailed reports on the performance, were in touch daily, and promptly
              responded to requests.</p>
            <p> During the cooperation, we developed a new web application for creating requests by customers and were
              engaged in the completion of mobile applications.</p>
            <p> During the development, we focused on the simplicity and intuitiveness of using the service. Since the
              product was initially quite complex, most of the work was on the formation of the simple basic concept.
              Within one month, the concept was revised several times and the product requirements were radically
              rewritten 4 times. The most important thing was to reduce the number of actions performed by the end-user
              to create a request and display complex elements in a simple form.</p>
            <p> Special attention was paid to UX design: the stages formation of creating a request, the arrangement of
              elements, and the creation of intuitive elements.</p>
            <p>Next, it is a matter of implementation under control of the project manager and the product manager. The
              experienced HTML developer, taking into account all possible states of elements, implemented interfaces
              close to pixel-perfect. Having divided the tasks, the development team implemented the product in close
              cooperation with the tester, configured integration with Yandex Maps, restructured the API (there was a
              problem of data heterogeneity, there was no single format for names and types of transmitted data) and
              added versioning, configured automatic deployment to the server directly from the repository.</p>
            <p>At the same time, flexibility was preserved throughout the entire process – there was no rigid binding to
              the specification, changes were made on the fly and this did not cause much discomfort in the work, since
              much attention was initially paid to the development of the concept.</p>

            <p>We express our sincere gratitude to the Updevision company. We approached them with our Trivers project
              after a bad experience with another company. Team loyalty, feedback, openness, and transparency of actions
              made our work truly comfortable.

            </p>
            <p> Updevision plunged into our business processes and helped to remove unnecessary features. Due to this,
              we managed to optimize the product for the modern market requirements in terms of technical components and
              design. We would especially like to note the high qualifications of the developers and the team's desire
              to see things through to the end. </p>
            <p> Thanks to this approach, we have completed the development of MVP and now we plan to expand and attract
              partners. Thank you, we will be glad to continue our cooperation!</p>
